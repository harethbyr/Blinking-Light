# Blinking-Light
This is my first project of a Blinking Light done on WOKWI on an Arduino Uno

# Parts Used
LED: 1
Arduino UNO: 1

# What it does
This code consistently causes the LED to blink using high and low voltage on UNO pin 8.

Using digitalWrite(8, HIGH) meaning high voltage on pin 8 and digitalWrite(8, HIGH) meaning low voltage on pin 8.

Add delay(100) to wait 100 milliseconds before low voltage and high voltage causing a blinking light.
